 * @brief Default-Implementation of the HardFault Handler

 * According Programming Manual:
 * A hard fault is an exception that occurs because of an error during
 * exception processing, or because an exception cannot be managed
 * by any other exception mechanism. Hard faults have a fixed priority
 * of -1, meaning they have higher priority than any exception with
 * configurable priority.

 * @brief Default-Implementation of the MemManage Handler
 *
 * According Programming Manual:
 * memory management fault is an exception that occurs because of
 * a memory protection related fault. The fixed memory protection
 * constraints determines this fault, for both instruction and data
 * memory transactions. This fault is used to abort instruction accesses
 * to Execute Never (XN) memory regions.

/**
 * @brief Default-Implementation of the UsageFault Handler
 *
 * According Programming Manual:
 * A usage fault is an exception that occurs because of a fault related
 * to instruction execution. This includes:
 *   • An undefined instruction
 *   • An illegal unaligned access
 *   • Invalid state on instruction execution
 *   • An error on exception return.
 *
 * The following can cause a usage fault when the core is configured to
 * report them:
 *   • An unaligned address on word and halfword memory access
 *   • Division by zero
