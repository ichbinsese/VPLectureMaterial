 * @brief Default-Implementation of the NMI Handler
 *
 * According Programming Manual:
 * A NonMaskable Interrupt (NMI) can be signalled by a peripheral or
 * triggered by software. This is the highest priority exception other
 * than reset. It is permanently enabled and has a fixed priority of -2.
 * NMIs cannot be:
 *   • Masked or prevented from activation by any other exception
 *   • Preempted by any exception other than Reset.

/**
 * @brief Default-Implementation of SysTick Handler

 * According Programming Manual:
 * A SysTick exception is an exception the system timer generates
 * when it reaches zero. Software can also generate a SysTick
 * exception. In an OS environment, the processor can use this
 * exception as system tick.
